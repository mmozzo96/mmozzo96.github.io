        I am Michele, an Italian software developer based in Helsinki.<br />
        I moved to Finland in 2021 and learned to love its sunny summers and
        even the dark snowy winters.<br />
        When I am not working I enjoy playing football, watching anime or gathering with
        friends and playing board games.

        As a software developer I experienced a little bit of everything
        alongside the full-stack of web applications, but I mostly worked on the

          <!-- I worked at P3 for over a year and it was during that time that I
          started building my career as a software developer.<br />
          Initially I was mostly working with satellite data, analyzing them
          with Python and processing them in an online server before hosting
          them on a simple map website. This is how I got to know how to build
          responsive websites with Javasctipt and React.js.<br />
          My seniors saw a good potential for me as a software engineer and
          encouraged me to go down that path. From there I started to work on
          one of the major product of the company, mainly as a frontend
          developer, but getting to know also how the backend was working and
          doing some minor implementations on that side as well.<br />
          In the following a more detailed description of the projects I worked on: -->
          I joined P3 in 2021 and worked with them for over a year. It was
          during that time that I started my career as a software engineer. I
          worked closely with my seniors that taught me the best practices for
          code developing and I learned how to synergize my and my team
          works.<br />
          In the following a more detailed description of the projects I worked
          on:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was a sole developer of an independent application written from
            scratch using <span class="highlight">Typescript</span>,
            <span class="highlight">TurboRepo</span>, and
            <span class="highlight">Next.js</span>.<br />
            The application was meant to be a replacement for a previous version
            of a project developed by the same company that was growing out of
            scale. The backend was the same as the previous project, that was
            still performant and I worked to reshape the frontend. My seniors
            followed the entire project providing me suggestions for libraries
            and code-reviewing my work frequently to ensure best pratices
            implementation.<br />
            We decided to utilize cutting edge libraries including:
            <span class="highlight">Zod</span>, and
            <span class="highlight">Yup</span> for form validations,
            <span class="highlight">react-query</span> for data fetching, and a
            modified <span class="highlight">Chakra-UI</span> for our
            components. For this project it was decided to employ
            <span class="highlight">CI</span> and
            <span class="highlight">CD</span> in Gitlab using docker containers
            for deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            I tested, debugged and developed a
            <span class="highlight">form application</span>.<br />
            The project was already in development when I joined the team that
            was working on it, but the frontend was still facing some major bugs
            that needed to be fixed. While debugging some new requirements came
            in and I worked closely with one developer from the team to
            implement all the new features.<br />
            The entire operation has involved mostly work in
            <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>, but some backend
            adjustments using
            <span class="highlight">Java Spring Boot</span> framework were
            required as well
          </li>
          <li>
            One of the projects consisted in enhancing an already existing
            <span class="highlight">portal application</span> for showing and
            sorting of data. The application was used to visualize and handle
            personal data. When I joined the project, new requirements came in
            from the client to show more data and enhance the ways of searching
            and sorting through them, which I implemented. The project was
            running on a <span class="highlight">Java backend</span> with a
            <span class="highlight">JavaScript frontend</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            My first project in the company revolved around implemention of
            Earth Observation satellite images into a map layer website to
            display environmental features and data.<br />
            The data were taken from open sources provider, mostly ESA, then
            processed in
            <span class="highlight">Python</span> and fetched to
            <span class="highlight">GeoServer</span>, a open source server, to
            host and refine the appearance before displaying them on a
            <span class="highlight">Leaflet</span> open map layer using
            <span class="highlight">React.js</span>.
